# CoVVSURF

R-package in development that implements a combination of clustering of
variables with feature selection using random forests. 

It depends mostly on ClutOfVar and VSURF packages.

Details are given in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06740](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06740).

The [vignette](https://github.com/robingenuer/CoVVSURF/blob/master/vignettes/intro_CoVVSURF.Rmd) gives instruction to install the package and basic instruction to apply the CoV/VSURF procedure in the context of classification and in the context of regression.
